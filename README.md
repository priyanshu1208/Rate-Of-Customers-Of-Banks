In this business case study, our main objective is to forecast the churning rate of customers in a bank. To achieve this, we will employ a powerful deep learning technique called Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). From the vast pool of bank customers, we have randomly selected a representative sample of 10,000 customers. By leveraging their unique characteristics and data, we aim to determine the probability of a customer leaving the bank. To build and train the ANN model, we will utilize popular Python libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and optimize its performance using techniques like the Adam Optimizer. The results obtained from this study can potentially provide valuable insights to help the bank retain its customers more effectively and improve overall customer satisfaction.
